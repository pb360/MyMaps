# My Maps

## *Paul Boehringer*

**Tippy** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Functionality 

* [x] User can enter create a new map with locations to save a name and pin of somewhere they went
* [x] Multiple map views 
* [x] saves data in local text file
* [x] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount. 

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [x] color changes 
* [x] terrain maps worked for a bit, but broke and I coudn't fix it.
